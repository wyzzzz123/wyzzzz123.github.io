            <p>Fresh fishing and hunting can be easily bought from fishing boats in Senbena, and can also be carried to a hotel to cook in person or to be handled by the hotel. PULAU BOHEY DULANG (translated as Pearl Island) is a quiet volcanic island not far from Senkamoto, which is also a Japanese Pearl Culture Station. </p>

            <p class="p1">Semporna</p>
            <p>Semporna literally means "perfect" in Malay. The town is surrounded by sea water, and Senbena and its affiliated islands are like an island of dreams in the real world. Pure white beaches, coconut trees and the quiet, beautiful turquoise waters of the Sulawesi Sea gently brush the colorful reefs.</p>

            <p>Earlier, the Bajau people lived in boats. Most of them lived along the coast or built houses on shallow rocks by piling piles. As always, they inherited their traditional custom of loving the sea as their family. There are various kinds of water sports, such as diving, boating and surfing.</p>
