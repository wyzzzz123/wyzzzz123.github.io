                <h2>The Forgotten Wonderland Semporna</h2>
                <p>Semporna is a county in Douhu Province, Sabah Prefecture, located on the east coast of Sabah Prefecture, Malaysia. Originally a small fishing village in Malaysia, Senbena is not even found on the map. Now it has gradually developed into a famous undersea world tourism center.

                <br>
                <h2>PULAU BOHEY DULANG</h2>
                <p>Fresh fishing and hunting can be easily bought from fishing boats in Senbena, and can also be carried to a hotel to cook in person or to be handled by the hotel. PULAU BOHEY DULANG (translated as Pearl Island) is a quiet volcanic island not far from Senkamoto, which is also a Japanese Pearl Culture Station. 
                </p >
                <br>
                <h2>The Island of Dreams in the Real World</h2>
                <p>Semporna literally means "perfect" in Malay. The town is surrounded by sea water, and Senbena and its affiliated islands are like an island of dreams in the real world. Pure white beaches, coconut trees and the quiet, beautiful turquoise waters of the Sulawesi Sea gently brush the colorful reefs.
                </p >

                <h2>The traditional custom of loving the sea like loving the family</h2>
                <p>Earlier, the Bajau people lived in boats. Most of them lived along the coast or built houses on shallow rocks by piling piles. As always, they inherited their traditional custom of loving the sea as their family. There are various kinds of water sports, such as diving, boating and surfing.
